# README - PROJECT WHISKERS

## Explanation of the Organization and Name Scheme for the Workspace
Project is divided into classes following standard naming protocol. CamelCase will be used in lieu of the less desirable under_Score method when namind variables and objects.

## Version Control Procedures
Use a separate branch for every task you work on. Do not review your own code. Delete branches after merge.(Scrum Lord exempt)
